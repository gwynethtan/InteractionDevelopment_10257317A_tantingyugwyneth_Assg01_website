My project idea is to create a website for a fictional company called “gwynethbakes”. The company sells affordable bakery DIY packs which contain instructions and ingredients to make a pastry. Customers are able to make the pastry at the comfort of their home and can use it as an opportunity to bond with their loved ones. Gwynethbakes aims to create an inclusive environment with the idea that anyone is able to bake. Baking should be an enjoyable experience for everyone.

This website is for anyone who wants to learn how to make a pastry. The website would have a happy and wholesome feel. Hence, I decided to use upbeat colors like orange and yellow and a cuter font to ensure that the website seems welcoming.
