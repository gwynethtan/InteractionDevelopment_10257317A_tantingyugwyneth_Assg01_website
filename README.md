# gwynethbakes

My project idea is to create a website for a fictional company called “gwynethbakes”. The company sells affordable bakery DIY packs which contain instructions and ingredients to make a pastry. Customers are able to make the pastry at the comfort of their home and can use it as an opportunity to bond with their loved ones. Gwynethbakes aims to create an inclusive environment with the idea that anyone is able to bake. Baking should be an enjoyable experience for everyone.This website is for anyone who wants to learn how to make a pastry. 


##Design process
The website would have a happy and wholesome feel. Hence, I decided to use upbeat colors like orange and yellow and a cuter font to ensure that the website seems welcoming.


## User stories 
As someone new to baking, I want the packs to have easy to follow instructions.

As a low or middle income person, I want the packs to be affordable.

As a person who is not tech savvy, I want the website to have good navigation so that I do not need to waste time on figuring out how to use the website.

As someone who likes to give constructive criticism, I want the website to have a contact us page so that I can give feedback easily.

As a busy person, I would like the website to have a filter function so that I do not have to waste time finding which pastry pack I would like to purchase.

As a person who loves deals, I would like the website to allow people to key in promo codes and get special offers.
